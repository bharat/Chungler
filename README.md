This app is designed to be a Mandarin companion and tutor for my 8 (almost 9!) year old son.

It's very basic-- really all it does is let users chat with an LLM (ChatGPT in this case) and lets you customize the experience for them via context injection. As an added bonus it will speak the answer back to you in Mandarin.
